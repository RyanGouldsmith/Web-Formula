#Web Formula 

Web Formula is a web based application using MathML, MathJax, PHP, SQL and Javascript
which will allow the user to search for a math formula via the name, if the formula is in the
database then it will display it to the user. If not, they will be given the
chance to add it to the database. I will have to use MathJax for non gecko browsers as
MathML is no longer supported in these broswers.
